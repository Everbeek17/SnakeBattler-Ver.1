# SnakeBattler-Ver.1
First attempt at a Snake Game. 

In multiplayer each player has their own food item to reach and eat. Anyone can run into a body part of anyone else (including themselves) so that's where the fun part comes in as everyone is constantly trying to avoid everyone else while trying to reach their own food item to grow bigger.
Also when a player dies their corpse gets left behind and becomes a new obstacle for other snakes to maneuvre around.

Had a lot of fun making this one because I could show it to my roommates and we could all play it together. What I would do is bluetooth my PS4 controllers to my laptop and map the arrow keys to different keyboard keys and use those keyboard keys to control individual snakes, that way we could play with PS4 controllers without having to crowd around a single keyboard.
